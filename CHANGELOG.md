# dos-analysis-web v2 CHANGELOG

This changelog starts at the v2 cleanup baseline. Older analyzer runs and case-level research history remain available in Git history and preserved result directories rather than in the active project changelog.

## [2026-07-17] Prepare the v2 tool-development baseline

### Changed

- Restored the preserved v2 engineering specification and retired the obsolete one-time cleanup plan and Stage 0–5 research design.
- Adopted the lifecycle-centered analysis direction based on bounded slices, Growth Contracts, lifecycle evidence, and effective Guard/Bound/Release reasoning.
- Normalized paper material under `docs/paper/` and repaired active documentation links.
- Kept the existing `poc/` evidence archive unchanged and stopped implicitly admitting new disclosure logs and probes into version control.
- Added a static CodeQL batch-build foundation and a static-only batch aggregator with configuration validation and regression tests.
- Kept dynamic-validation preparation and status synchronization as explicit opt-in helpers, isolated from the ordinary v2 static pipeline.

### Verification

- Python and shell syntax checks.
- Unit tests for manifest/config validation, path handling, dry-run behavior, static aggregation, case identity, overwrite protection, and status synchronization.
- Markdown-link, JSON, gzip, and Git workspace hygiene checks.

## [2026-07-02] Reset the workspace for v2 implementation

### Changed

- Established the v2 static model:
  `Vulnerable(E, G) := Reach(E, G) ∧ AttackerControls(E, G) ∧ Growth(G) ∧ ¬EffectiveB(E, G)`.
- Preserved framework sources, CodeQL databases, PoC evidence, static-hunt results, application results, and Java Web batch results.
- Removed legacy phase-oriented analyzer implementation from the active development context.
